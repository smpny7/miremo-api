## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up Node.js and the Firebase CLI
You'll need a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) environment to write functions,
and the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#setup_update_cli) to deploy functions to the Cloud Functions runtime.

```shell
$ npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Associate with your Firebase project.

```shell
$ firebase login
```


### Step 2: Deploy your back-end server

Your Firebase project must be on the [Blaze pricing plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing).
See [Cloud Functions pricing](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#functions-pricing).

```shell
$ firebase deploy
```
